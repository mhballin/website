      <p class="text-lg">I turn <b>innovative ideas</b> into real products. I co-founded Blueprint Surf to make surfboards, 
        with a focus on <b>practical design</b> and <b>intentional sustainability</b>. My background 
        gives me a <b>systems perspective</b>, so I care about how things are made, used, and what happens after. 
        If you want to see what practical, thoughtful product development looks like, you’re in the right place.

    <div class="text-3xl w-full font-bold">About</div>
    <p class="text-lg">For the past four years, I’ve been hands-on at every stage of building products 
      from scratch. I helped launch <b>Blueprint Surf</b>, where we made surfboards with 
      <b>3D-printed cores</b> and <b>sustainable materials</b>—testing, tweaking, and fixing 
      things as we went. When prototypes failed, I led the root-cause work, made 
      changes, and kept pushing until we got it right.</p>

    <p class="text-lg">I managed supply-chain headaches, like <b>finding new 
      vendors on short notice</b> when our main supplier folded, and <b>partnered 
        with labs</b> to test materials we couldn’t afford in-house. I handled the 
        day-to-day—<b>production, inventory, shipping</b>, and customer support—and 
        got the word out by translating technical work into clear, trustworthy stories.</p>

    <p class="text-lg">My approach is practical: <b>test, build, learn, repeat</b>. 
      I care about <b>making things that last</b> and <b>solving real problems</b>, 
      not just managing processes. That’s what drives me.</p>
