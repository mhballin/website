      <p class="text-lg">I combine <b>technical innovation</b> with business impact. As co-founder of Blueprint, 
      I develop advanced composite products from 3D-printed surfboard cores to optimized manufacturing 
      systems. Environmental scientist turned entrepreneur, I bring a unique perspective to solving 
      complex product development challenges across the full lifecycle: <b>design, materials, manufacturing, 
      and cost optimization</b>.</p>

    <div class="text-3xl w-full font-bold">About</div>
    <p class="text-lg">I have over four years of hands-on experience building and running lean 
    manufacturing operations, from material sourcing and process development to quality control and 
    field-tested validation. My approach blends structured testing with rapid iteration to deliver 
    reliable, production-ready outcomes in demanding real-world conditions.</p>

    <p class="text-lg">When early prototypes failed, I led root-cause analysis, corrected structural 
    assumptions, and put validation checkpoints in place before scale-up. I also managed supply chain 
    risk, qualifying new vendors when primary suppliers shut down, and formed research partnerships 
    that expanded access to advanced lab capabilities.</p>

    <p class="text-lg">As a founder, I owned day-to-day operations: production planning, inventory, 
    fulfillment, and customer experience. I led <b>go-to-market execution</b>, built an organic 
    community, and secured earned media by translating technical work into clear, credible narratives 
    that built trust and sustained demand.</p>
