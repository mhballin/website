    <div class="text-xl py-1">Hello 👋</div>
    <div class="text-5xl font-bold">I'm Michael Ballin</div>
    <div class="text-3xl py-3 font-bold">Product Developer | Entrepreneur </div>
    <div class="py-2 space-y-4">
      <p class="text-lg">I combine <b>technical innovation</b> with a strong commitment to <b>environmental stewardship</b> to create high-impact 
      products from concept to market. As co-founder of Blueprint Surf, I led the development of advanced 
      composite solutions, optimizing 3D-printed surfboard cores and refining manufacturing systems, 
      all guided by the philosophy of turning waste into performance. My entrepreneurial experience 
      includes building a lean additive manufacturing business from the ground up and consistently 
      applying <b>adaptive problem-solving</b> to address operational and <b>technical challenges</b>.</p>

      <p class="text-lg">My background as an <b>Environmental Scientist and Entrepreneur</b> gives me a comprehensive 
      perspective on <b>complex product challenges</b>. I leverage expertise in advanced composites, 
      <b>parametric design</b> (Rhino/Grasshopper), and lean operations to optimize every stage of the product lifecycle, 
      including design, materials, manufacturing efficiency, and cost. I excel at 
      <b>translating technical requirements</b> into production-ready designs and conducting rigorous 
      testing to ensure performance and durability.</p>

      <p class="text-lg">In addition to product and engineering, my work includes <b>strategic business development</b> 
      and <b>operational leadership</b>. I have managed complex supply chains, overseen production, 
      and led brand-building initiatives that foster community and generate significant 
      media coverage. My experience also includes establishing partnerships with research institutes 
      and academic programs, reflecting a broad approach to <b>achieving technical excellence</b> and market impact. 
      I thrive in mission-driven environments where innovation, sustainability, and <b>strategic operations align</b>.</p>
